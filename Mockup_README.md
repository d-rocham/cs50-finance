_Harvard's CS50 last problem set with several twists!_

__CS50: Finance__ is a Flask-powered web application that allows the user to <project description>.

While the project requirements [do not demand using external libraries for form validation, ](https://cs50.harvard.edu/x/2021/psets/9/finance/) nor using JavaScript, I seized the opportunity to implement <functionalities implemented with libraries> with WTF-Forms, Flask-SQLAlchemy and <other libraries used along the way>, as well as using vainilla JavaScript and the <form validation API>.

As the project scope is mainly focused on learning back end technologies, the web application UI was styled using Bootstrap CSS, although it might be improved with custom SCSS in the future.
